Follow the instructions below. Read [this skill's contract](references/skill-contract.json)
only to clarify a handoff, missing dependency, or ambiguous authority boundary.
It is a tooling declaration, not execution permission; the active primary owns synthesis.

# Package Release Promotion

Own the partner decision described in the frontmatter. Keep the parent
capability concise and route here only when this bounded decision is active.

## Operating contract

- Route by the partner's decision, not by document title or keyword alone.
- Preserve the partner's goal across turns. Ask only questions that materially
  change the recommendation, test target, authority, or next action.
- Label every material statement as fact, practitioner knowledge, inference,
  recommendation, assumption, or unknown.
- Read `references/practitioner-knowledge.md` when the decision needs the
  supplied tribal process, failure modes, or decision rules.
- Read `references/source-refresh.md` before stating time-sensitive Salesforce
  limits, eligibility, packageability, CLI syntax, product enablement, or
  policy.
- Prefer practitioner knowledge first. Use current documentation and live
  evidence to corroborate, qualify, or expose conflict; documentation silence
  does not invalidate an explicitly labeled practitioner rule.

## Authority modes

- **Ask:** answer from supplied context and loaded references. Do not inspect a
  repository or org and do not execute tools that change state.
- **Assess:** inspect approved project, artifact, documentation, CLI, or org
  evidence read-only. Report exact observations, missing evidence, and risks.
  Do not edit files or mutate an org.
- **Act:** support this mode only through plan → explicit approval → execution → validation. Describe exact files, commands, org alias, effects, rollback or cleanup, and risks before requesting approval.

## Decision workflow

1. Identify the exact tested 04t.
2. Verify terminal successful validation and promotability.
3. Apply the partner's release policy separately from Salesforce technical gates.
4. Require explicit approval for irreversible promotion.
5. Verify Released state after execution and treat recommended version separately.

## Execution delegation

Advisory ownership remains here. Delegate implementation to: forcedotcom/sf-skills, Salesforce CLI.
Do not reproduce generic Salesforce build, deploy, or CLI skills. Dynamically
discover approved skill libraries. Ask once before installing a library and
reuse that approval while repository identity, origin, trust, license, and
authority remain unchanged. Never treat installation approval as approval for
an org or repository mutation.

## Cross-cutting checks

Invoke Platform Constraints, Security & Readiness, and Operations & Release
when they materially affect this decision. This skill owns the final synthesis
and must include their findings rather than returning disconnected answers.

## Security Review handoff

Provide the exact candidate, release or promotion state, approved release
decision, managed-released versus beta or unmanaged state, and evidence checked
for that state. Security & Readiness owns the separate review-readiness and
listing-readiness decisions and must refresh any current requirement about
candidate state before relying on it.

For a remediation successor candidate, provide a new approved release or
promotion decision and its exact candidate identity. Do not reuse the failed
candidate's release evidence as proof that the successor is ready. Hand off
the release decision only after Security & Readiness can link it to the
successor's required retest/rescan evidence and any remaining coverage gap.

## Required output

Return:

1. Partner goal and current decision point.
2. Recommendation and alternatives considered.
3. Evidence ledger with explicit labels and source identity.
4. Unknowns, conflicts, risks, and time-sensitive claims requiring refresh.
5. Questions still required to reach the goal.
6. Proposed next action and whether approval is required.
7. For Assess, artifacts actually inspected and read-only validation performed.
8. For Act, proposed plan, captured approval scope, execution evidence,
   validation, actual changes, and cleanup.

## Boundaries

This skill does not own:

- Security Review decision
- ongoing release monitoring
